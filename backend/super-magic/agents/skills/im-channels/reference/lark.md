# Lark AI Bot

Connects via Lark Long Connection (WebSocket) mode with streaming typing support.

## Prerequisites

Create an enterprise self-built app on the Lark Open Platform and obtain:
- **App ID**: The App ID from application credentials
- **App Secret**: The App Secret from application credentials

Complete the following configuration on the Lark Open Platform:
1. Event Subscription → Long Connection (WebSocket) → Enable long connection for receiving events
2. Event Subscription → Add Event → Search and add "Receive Messages v2.0 (im.message.receive_v1)"
3. App Permissions → Request and enable: `im:message`, `cardkit:card`

## Credential Collection

Ask the user in sequence:
1. "Please provide the Lark app's App ID"
2. "Please provide the corresponding App Secret"

## Establish Connection

(Use run_sdk_snippet tool, python_code parameter:)

```
from sdk.tool import tool

result = tool.call("connect_lark_bot", {
    "app_id": "<App ID provided by user>",
    "app_secret": "<App Secret provided by user>",
})
print(result.content)
```

## Result Handling

- Success: "Lark bot connected successfully. You can now chat with me in Lark with streaming typing support."
- Failure: Report the error, suggest checking whether App ID/Secret are correct, and whether app permissions and event subscriptions have been configured
